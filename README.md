# CPP-Linux-Login-System

this is a basic login system created in C++ for linux OS machines, this is not anything good for protection just a fun project in linux you can also see that I have created a sleep function do with that as you will.

Note: the register system does not work properly but you can fix this very easily (don't define strings) and write then and grab from a text file.

if you would like me to fix this and make this a proper login system in linux let me know. (Zorpze#1336)
